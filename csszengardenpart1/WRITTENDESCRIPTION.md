VERSION 2 is my final wireframe for this project. I included the first version to show my process of getting this design. 


My theme to my CSS Zen Garden is a clean design that presents the in formation in a clear blocked layout which would provide a easy to navigate website. I see my Css Zen Garden wireframe being aesthetically pleasing while keeping the information easily accessible. 

I am hoping that user does not feel overwhelmed by the layout that the content is lost. I hope that the user feels a sense of trust, confidence and ease from the layout. I also would like to have a layout that is modern in feel so the user feels that it is not dated and appealing to the user. 

I started looking at website that aesthetically I liked. One is http://www.chanel.com/ I love the layout and design style that is simple but classy. Typically, design/navigation wise I donâ€™t usually like websites for high end clothing because they are confusing but I feel this site navigates a lot of information in a nice manner.
